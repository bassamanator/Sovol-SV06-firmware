## Preface

Although I've made switching over to Klipper as easy as is possible, it can still be a challenge for some, especially considering that most of you have likely never used GNU+Linux. Save yourself the frustration, and _fully read all the documentation on this page_. Also note that Klipper is not a _must_, and is not for everyone. You can stick with Marlin, and have a fine 3D printing experience.

## Before You Begin

- This entire page is a **13 minute read**. Save yourself _hours of troubleshooting_ and read this documentation fully.
- Make sure your printer is in good physical condition, because print and travel speeds will be _a lot faster_ than they were before. Beginner's would be wise to go through the steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/blob/main/initialsteps.md). Consider yourself warned.
- Follow the steps in order.
- If an error was reported at a step, do no proceed to the next step.
- It is assumed that you are connected to your host Raspberry Pi (or other host device) via SSH, and that your printer motherboard is connected to the host via a data USB cable. üí° Most of the micro USB cables that you find at home are _unlikely_ to be data cables, and it's not possible to tell just by looking.
- [Disable](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06/blob/main/howto.md#disable-usb-cable-5v-pin) the USB cable's 5V pin.
- It is also assumed that the username on the host device is `pi`. If that is not the case, you will have to manually edit `moonraker.conf` and `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg` and change any mentions of `/home/pi` to `/home/yourUserName`.
- Klipper _must_ be installed on the host Raspberry Pi for everything to work. Easiest is to use a [MainsailOS](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/releases/latest) image. Alternatively, you can install `Fluidd` or `Mainsail` via [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh).
- Robert Redford's performance in _Spy Game (2001)_ was superb!
- It is assumed that there is one instance of Klipper installed. If you have multiple instances of Klipper installed, via `KIAUH` for example, then this guide is not for you. You can still use all the configs of course, but the steps in this guide will likely not work for you.
- Your question has probably been answered already, but if it hasn't, please post in the [Discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions) section.
- I would recommend searching for the word `NOTE` in this repository. There are roughly half a dozen short points amongst the various files that you should be aware of if you're using this configuration.

## Klipper Installation

### Flash Firmware

üí° If you have already flashed klipper onto your motherboard in the past, you can skip this step.

Please note:

- For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the klipper firmware file as `klipper.bin` even though the actual filename is something along the lines of `klipper-v0.11.0-148-g52f4e20c.bin`.
- The firmware file is located in the `misc` folder.
- Flashing will only work if current firmware filename is _different from previous flashing procedure_. The `.bin` is also important.
- You may find this [video](https://youtu.be/p6l253OJa34) useful.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many users have reported having issues flashing Klipper using the Sovol microSD card.

#### 1. Prepare the microSD Card for Flashing with These Parameters

- Size: `16GB` maximum.
- File system: `FAT32`.
- Allocation unit size: `4096 bytes`.
- Must not contain any files _except_ the firmware file.

#### 2. Flashing Procedure

1. Disconnect any USB cables that might be connected to the motherboard.
2. Copy `klipper.bin` to the microSD card.
3. Make sure the printer is off.
4. Insert the microSD card into printer.
5. Turn on the printer and wait a minute (usually takes 10 seconds).
6. Turn off the printer and remove the microSD.

‚è≤Ô∏è At this point, it's not possible to tell with certainty whether your flash was successful, continue on with the guide. A good sign that it worked is the touchscreen not progressing past the Sovol logo on power-on.

### Download OSS Klipper Configuration

You can choose _either_ of the 2 following methods.

#### Method 1: Clone the Repository

1. `cd ~/printer_data/config`
2. Empty entire `~/printer_data/config` folder.
   - In linux, you can delete files via `rm fileName` and directories via `rmdir directoryName`.
   - In linux, you can list files and folders via `ls -lah`.
3. `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware.git .` ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't miss the period!

#### Method 2: Download the ZIP

1. [Download](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the `ZIP` file containing the Klipper configuration.
2. See `Step 2` in `Method 1`.
3. The parent folder in the `ZIP` is `Sovol-SV06-firmware-master`. This is relevant in the next step.
4. Extract **only** the _contents_ of the parent folder into `~/printer_data/config`.

## Initial Steps

### Adjust Configuration with MCU Path

*NB* If you are using KIAUH, in the menu under [4] Advanced, you will find an option to identify the `mcu` port. 

1. Find what port the `mcu` (printer motherboard) is connected to via **one** of the following commands:

   - `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*`
   - `ls /dev/serial/by-path/*`

   1. The output will be something along the lines of
      - `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0`

The following steps are completed in the Mainsail web interface. You can locate this at the same ip address as your pi. The KIAUH automatically sets up the services required to run Mainsail when the pi is turned on.

2. Adjust the `[mcu]` section in `printer.cfg` accordingly.

   ```yaml
   # üóíÔ∏è This is just an example
   [mcu]
   serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB2.0-Serial-if00-port0
   restart_method: command
   ```

3. Do a `FIRMWARE_RESTART`.

If the Klipper flash that you did earlier was successful, and you've done everything else correctly, you should see no errors or warnings in the Mainsail/Fluidd dashboard. **Klipper has successfully been installed on your printer!**

### Configure Your Printer

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Your finger should be on the power switch for most of these steps** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

‚ùó‚ò†Ô∏è **Power off if there is a collision/problem** ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ùó

üí° The ${\small{\textcolor{red}{\texttt{EMERGENCY STOP}}}}$ button in your dashboard works faster than hitting the power switch.

üí° Do a practice emergency stop.

üí° I recommend no filament be loaded for any of these steps.

üóíÔ∏è Find explanations for gcode commands: [https://marlinfw.org/](https://marlinfw.org/), [https://www.klipper3d.org/](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html).

You will be pasting/typing these commands into the Mainsail/Fluidd console.

1. Check to see if `X` and `Y` max positions can be reached, and adjust `position_max`, if necessary. You might be able to go further, which is great, but I recommend leaving a 2mm gap for safety.
   1. `G28`
   2. `G90`
   3. `G1 X223 F3000`
   4. `G1 Y223 F3000`
2. Do a mechanical gantry calibration; `G34`. After the controlled collision against the beam at the top, there will be a 10 second pause for you to verify that both sides of the gantry are pressed up against the `stoppers` at the top. You will hear a succession of beeps.
   1. Figure out your `Z` `position_max` by baby stepping your way up to the beam, and adjust `position_max`, if necessary.
3. PID tune the bed. Ideally, all PID tuning should occur at the temperatures that you print most at.
   1. `PID_TEST_BED TEMP=70`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
4. PID tune the extruder while part cooling fan runs at 25%.
   1. `PID_TEST_HOTEND TEMP=245`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
5. Adjust `z_offset`. Make sure your nozzle if very clean. Do the [Paper test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html?h=probe_calibrate#the-paper-test).
   1. `DO_PROBE_CALIBRATE`
   2. Follow `z_offset` setup in Mainsail/Fluidd.
   3. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)
6. Create a bed mesh.
   1. `DO_CREATE_MESH`
   2. `SAVE_CONFIG` (once completed)

üèÅ If you've made it here, then your printer has been Klipperized, and is ready to print! üèÅ

But first, adjust your slicer.

## Adjust Your Slicer

üí° If you are using the config bundles found on this repo, you can skip this step.

You need to adjust the start and end gcode in your slicer. The relevant macros are `PRINT_START` and `PRINT_END`. Find instructions [here](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/passing_slicer_variables.html#slicer-start-g-code).

If you would like to print a purge line before your print starts, at the end of your start gcode, on a new line add `PURGE_LINE`.

```yaml
# üóíÔ∏è This is just an example
PRINT_START ...
PURGE_LINE
```

## FAQ

### How do I import a configuration bundle into SuperSlicer/PrusaSlicer?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions/13).

### How do I print using SuperSlicer?

Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware/discussions/14).

### When does beeping occur?

The printer will beep upon:

- Filament runout.
- Filament change/`M600`.
- Upon `PRINT_END`.
- `MECHANICAL_GANTRY_CALIBRATION`/`G34` (beeping will occur even if beeping is disabled, as long as you have a speaker on your board).

Adjust behaviour according to your needs.

| File     | `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg`     |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| Section  | `[gcode_macro _globals]`   |
| Variable | `variable_beeping_enabled` |
| Disable  | `0`                        |
| Enable   | `1` (default)              |

### I want to use a filament sensor. How do I set it up?

You can find information about the physical setup [here](https://github.com/bassamanator/everything-sovol-sv06#filament-sensor).

Adjust behaviour according to your needs.

| File     | `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg`             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Section  | `[gcode_macro _globals]`           |
| Variable | `variable_filament_sensor_enabled` |
| Disable  | `0` (default)                      |
| Enable   | `1`                                |

### My filament runout sensor works, but I just started a print without any filament loaded. What gives?

A simple runout sensor can only detect a change in state. So, if you start a print without filament loaded, the printer will not know that there is no filament loaded. You should test your sensor by having filament loaded, starting a print, then cutting the filament. The expected behaviour is that the print will pause, and as long as you have beeping enabled, you will hear 3 annoying beeps.

### What happens when I put in `M600`/colour change at a certain layer?

1. The printer will beep 3 times (not annoyingly).
2. Printing will stop.
3. The printhead will park itself front center.
4. The hotend will turn off, but the bed will remain hot.

### What happens when I pause a print?

Same behaviour as `M600`/colour change _except_ there won't be any beeping.

### What happens when filament runs out?

_If_ you have a working filament sensor, the same behaviour as `M600`/colour change will occur _except_ the beeps will be fairly annoying.

### How do I resume a print after a colour change or filament runout?

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not disable the stepper motors during this process!

The printhead is now parked front center waiting for you to insert filament. You will:

1. Heat up the hotend to the desired temperature.
   - Use your Klipper dashboard.
2. Purge (push) some filament through the nozzle.
   - Use your Klipper dashboard, and extrude maybe 50mm (for a colour change you probably want to extrude more).
   - OR, you can push some filament by hand _making sure to first disengage the extruder's spring loaded arm_.
3. Hit resume in your Klipper dashboard.

### How do I enable KAMP (Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging)?

Although this repo contains all the code from the KAMP repository, only the `mesh` functionality of KAMP has been configured and tested. To enable other functionality, adjust `/cfgs/kamp/KAMP_Settings.cfg`.

The [Label objects setting](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/overview/features/exclude-objects#enable-the-label-objects-setting-in-your-slicer) in your slicer must be enabled for KAMP to work.

‚ö†Ô∏è If KAMP is disabled, and you don't have a `default` mesh stored in your `printer.cfg`, `PRINT_START` will crash.

‚ö†Ô∏è KAMP cannot be used with low-powered devices such as the Raspberry Pi Zero.

Adjust behaviour according to your needs.

| File     | `cfgs/misc-macros.cfg`   |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Section  | `[gcode_macro _globals]` |
| Variable | `variable_kamp_enable`   |
| Disable  | `0` (default)            |
| Enable   | `1`                      |

### How do I use the `TEST_SPEED` macro?

‚ö†Ô∏è This is for advanced users only, with well oiled machines. You can cause serious damage to your printer if you're not careful. ‚ò†Ô∏è **You have been warned** ‚ò†Ô∏è.

Find full instructions [here](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/determining_max_speeds_accels.html).

Some tips:

- Before running with `ITERATIONS=40` with an untested speed/accel value, run with `ITERATIONS=1`.
- Pay close attention throughout the run, so that you can click ${\small{\textcolor{red}{\texttt{EMERGENCY STOP}}}}$ at a moment's notice.
- This macro will simply help you determine the maximum speed your printhead and bed can reliably move at, not necessarily print at. The bottleneck for my SV06, for example, is the 15mm/s^2 that the hotend maxes out at (well under 200mm/s actual print speed).
